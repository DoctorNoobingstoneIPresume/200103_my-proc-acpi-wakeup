[2020-01-03] my-proc-acpi-wakeup:

Many Linux computers are, by default,
configured to be woken up from Stand-by
for any movement/button-press of the USB mouse or any key-press of a USB keyboard.

(The behaviour for the movement of the USB mouse is particularly annoying.)

In order to disable this behaviour, we have to run:
	echo "USB0" > /proc/acpi/wakeup
	echo "USB1" > /proc/acpi/wakeup
	# etc. for each line in the output of 'cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep -Pi "USB.*enabled"'.
	# Each redirected "echo" toggles the behaviour of the specified device.

This project attempts to automatize this at every start-up.



How can this project be used ?

The following commands should be run as "root":
	
	cp lib/systemd/system/my-proc-acpi-wakeup.service /lib/systemd/system/
	cp etc/my-proc-acpi-wakeup                        /etc/
	chmod +x                                          /etc/my-proc-acpi-wakeup
	
	systemctl daemon-reload
	
	# Test once:
	cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep -Pi "USB.*enabled" # This might show some lines.
	systemctl start my-proc-acpi-wakeup
	cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep -Pi "USB.*enabled" # This should no longer show any line.
	
	# Enable running at every start-up:
	systemctl enable my-proc-acpi-wakeup
	
	# Debug:
	journalctl --no-pager -l --unit my-proc-acpi-wakeup
